## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **Pip**: Python's package installer.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snippet-manager
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   Install necessary dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install fpdf passlib
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   Launch Snippet Manager with:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Authentication
- **Register:** Sign up with a unique username and secure password.
- **Login:** Log in with your credentials to access your saved snippets.
- **Password Reset:** If you forget your password, answer a security question to reset it.

### Snippet Operations
- **Add Snippet:** Provide a programming language, tags, a description, and the code content.
- **View Snippets:** List all snippets or search by language, tag, or keyword in the description.
- **Update Snippet:** Modify an existing snippet's details.
- **Delete Snippet:** Remove a snippet permanently.
- **Search Snippets:** Quickly find snippets using keywords, tags, or language.

### Export to PDF
Generate a PDF file containing all saved snippets with a title, language, description, and code content. This feature is useful for backing up, sharing, or viewing snippets offline.

#### Example Workflow

```bash
# Start the app
python main.py

# Register a new account
-> Register
Username: johndoe
Password: ******

# Login
-> Login
Username: johndoe
Password: ******

# Add a new snippet
-> Add Snippet
Language: Python
Tags: web scraping, requests
Description: A simple web scraping snippet to fetch HTML content.
Code:
import requests
response = requests.get('https://example.com')
print(response.text)

# Export snippets to PDF
-> Export to PDF
PDF generated: snippets.pdf
```

## Project Structure
- **`main.py`**: Main application script containing the core logic and functions.
- **`User_details.json`**: JSON file that securely stores user account details, including hashed passwords.
- **`Snippets.json`**: JSON file where user-created snippets are stored.
- **`utils/pdf_generator.py`**: Utility for creating a downloadable PDF file containing all snippets.

## Configuration and Customization
- **Password Hashing Algorithm**: Uses `passlib` with `PBKDF2_SHA256` for secure password hashing. This can be customized in `main.py`.
- **JSON File Paths**: Modify the paths to `User_details.json` and `Snippets.json` if required.
- **PDF Styling**: Update font and formatting in `utils/pdf_generator.py` to personalize PDF output.

## Security
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed with `PBKDF2_SHA256` using `passlib`, ensuring no plaintext passwords are stored.
- **Security Questions**: Users are prompted to set a security question, used for account recovery.
- **Encrypted Storage**: Consider implementing further encryption for `User_details.json` if storing sensitive data.

## Dependencies
- **fpdf**: For generating PDFs to export code snippets.
- **passlib**: Used to hash passwords for secure authentication.

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
